The dataset provided contains information about road accidents, including various attributes such as accident date, severity, weather conditions, and more. You are expected to explore this dataset, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and present insightful visualizations through a well-designed dashboard.





**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

    ⮚ Explore the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of different

       variables.

    ⮚ Identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.

    ⮚ Select relevant KPIs based on your analysis.



**2. Dashboard Design:**

    ⮚ Design an interactive dashboard with multiple visualizations to effectively

      communicate insights from the data.

    ⮚ Include a variety of charts and graphs such as bar charts, line charts, maps, etc.

    ⮚ Ensure the dashboard layout is intuitive and user-friendly.

    

**3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

    ⮚ Accident Severity Distribution

    ⮚ Number of Accidents Over Time

    ⮚ Distribution of Accidents by Day of the Week

    ⮚ Top Junction Controls Contributing to Accidents

    ⮚ Weather Conditions vs. Number of Accidents

    ⮚ Road Surface Conditions vs. Number of Accidents

&nbsp;   ⮚ Top 10 cities by accidents

&nbsp;   ⮚ Impact of Road type by Accident Severity

&nbsp;   ⮚ Top 5 weather conditions by accidents

&nbsp;   ⮚ Vehicle type Involvement



**4. Filters:** Filter dashboard based on year, area (urban/rural) and lighting conditions
